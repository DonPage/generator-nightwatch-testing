## Getting Started

Not every new computer comes with a Yeoman pre-installed. He lives in the [npm](https://npmjs.org) package repository. You only have to ask for him once, then he packs up and moves into your hard drive. *Make sure you clean up, he likes new and shiny things.*

```bash
npm install -g yo
```

### Nightwatch-Testing

To install generator-nightwatch-testing from npm, run:

```bash
npm install -g generator-nightwatch-testing
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
